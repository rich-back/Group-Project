## The Brief

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive browser applications that display information in a fun and interesting way. Your task is to make a Minimum Viable Product that enables the user to: explore the names of the elements of the periodic table and  learn the groups of the periodic table.  Our user is a 14-16 year-old National 5 student studying Chemistry.

### MVP

A user should be able to:

* View some information about the elements of the periodic table
* Move between elements that are in the same group
* Show the whole periodic table
